[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Vinelab/RSS.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Vinelab/RSS)

## RSS 2.0 Client

## Installation
Refer to [vinelab/rss on packagist.org](https://packagist.org/packages/vinelab/rss) for composer installation instructions.

Edit **app.php** and add ```'Vinelab\Rss\RssServiceProvider',``` to the ```'providers'``` array.

It will automatically alias itself as **RSS** so no need to aslias it in your **app.php** unless you would like to customize it. In that case edit your **'aliases'** in **app.php** adding ``` 'MyRSS'    => 'Vinelab\Rss\Facades\RSS',```

## Usage

<?php

$feed = RSS::feed('http://feeds.reuters.com/news/artsculture');

// $feed is now an instance of Vinelab\Rss\Feed

$count = $feed->articlesCount(); // 10

$info = $feed->info();
